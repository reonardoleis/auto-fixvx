# auto-fixvx

Python script designed to streamline the process of fixing Twitter links (using vxtwitter) for optimal preview display on platforms like Discord. The script detects when a Twitter link is present on the clipboard and automatically transforms it into a vxtwitter link using the fixvx version of the site. This ensures that the link will be rendered properly.

It can be set to run on system startup as a background process, or it can be run manually.
